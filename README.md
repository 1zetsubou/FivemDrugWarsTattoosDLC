**NEW TATTOOS DLC "DRUG WARS"**

PREVIEW: https://youtu.be/P2PM31oQb-s

Welcome back everyone!, I'm making this forum post to share something interesting for you...
As in our previous post which you can find here -->(https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-free-add-on-new-tattoo-dlc-criminal-enterprises/4903471.), we are here to show you and share the new tattoo pack of the “Drug Wars” dlc (b2802).
In the video you can preview all the male and female tattoos.

Credits go to the "Dream Development" Team for exporting the native files and customizing them so they can be used with various tattoo streaming scripts.

This resource has files for all available tattoos from the latest "Drug Wars" DLC only.
It can be incorporated together with resource releases from (https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-dlc-tattoos-as-add-ons-updated/191320942), such that a complete set of all the latest and new tattoos.
Mainly the resource is standalone and must be implemented only with a dependency on the tattoo script that you have available on your server, while for those who use ESX I have simplified your work.
You will find the folder and layouts created to be streamed to ESX by the script (https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-xntattoos-esx/1043132) and inside the download you will find the file renamed 'xntattoos_intallation.txt' which will explain the installation method.
I want to clarify that this is an independent resource from any script, therefore standalone and you just need to enter them manually based on the configuration of your streaming tattoo script.
